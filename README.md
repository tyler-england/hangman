#Hangman
Hangman game, two modes of functionality

1: Play hangman! Try to guess the word that the computer has chosen.

2: Use the program to help guess a word that someone else has chosen. Each turn, the program suggests the best letter to guess (most likely to exist in the word). And with each attempt, the program narrows down the list of possible words.

Both modes have a simple ASCII hangman, which gets drawn as incorrect letters are guessed.
